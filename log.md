# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 24th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Set up repositories on Github for freeCodeCamp/Codepen projects and 100 Days of Code Challenge. Uploaded basic finished version of Tribute Page Project and started work on Survey Form Project.  Installed Git.

**Thoughts:** Slowly grasping things more and more.  Still a long way off.  Need to get back into making progress on CS50, as I've let that sit for too long.  Need to set up a repository for those projects too.

### Day 1: January 25th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Did some more basic HTML coding of Survey Form Project on freeCodeCamp. Reviewed some of the challenges to keep fresh and also took a look at some info on W3Schools.

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as much done today as I would have wanted, but I had to stay later at work than anticipated.  That ate into my time a bit more than I would have liked.  Still, glad I got some things done today.  Need to spend some time coding this weekend and maybe get some CS50 done.  Also I HAVE to start getting better acquainted with Github/Git so I can update repositories, etc. correctly.

### Day 2: January 26th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Worked a little bit on Survey Form Project.  Added a tiny bit of CSS.  Read up a bit on freeCodeCamp and W3Schools to refresh.  Started using Git Bash to push commits from local to Github.

**Thoughts:** Really felt accomplished despite my minimal progress on the actual project.  Pushing via Git Bash rather than Github felt like a big step.  I'm eager to learn more of the intracacies of Git and growing progressively more comfortable using it.
