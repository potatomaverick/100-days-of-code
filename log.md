# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 24th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Set up repositories on Github for freeCodeCamp/Codepen projects and 100 Days of Code Challenge. Uploaded basic finished version of Tribute Page Project and started work on Survey Form Project.  Installed Git.

**Thoughts:** Slowly grasping things more and more.  Still a long way off.  Need to get back into making progress on CS50, as I've let that sit for too long.  Need to set up a repository for those projects too.

### Day 1: January 25th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Did some more basic HTML coding of Survey Form Project on freeCodeCamp. Reviewed some of the challenges to keep fresh and also took a look at some info on W3Schools.

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as much done today as I would have wanted, but I had to stay later at work than anticipated.  That ate into my time a bit more than I would have liked.  Still, glad I got some things done today.  Need to spend some time coding this weekend and maybe get some CS50 done.  Also I HAVE to start getting better acquainted with Github/Git so I can update repositories, etc. correctly.

### Day 2: January 26th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Worked a little bit on Survey Form Project.  Added a tiny bit of CSS.  Read up a bit on freeCodeCamp and W3Schools to refresh.  Started using Git Bash to push commits from local to Github.

**Thoughts:** Really felt accomplished despite my minimal progress on the actual project.  Pushing via Git Bash rather than Github felt like a big step.  I'm eager to learn more of the intracacies of Git and growing progressively more comfortable using it.

### Day 3: January 27th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Worked on Survey Project again.  Added classes and implemented a CSS grid.  Project is now better organized visually and CSS style has been applied in a more efficient manner.

**Thoughts:** Definitely muddled through some things, but I think I understand the difference between *class* and *id* better now.  Also was good to implement a CSS Grid and get a feel for that outside of the brief feeCodeCamp challenge.  Another day where I wish I had done some more, but it was nice to enjoy a bit of free time on a weekend.

### Day 4: January 28th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Finished the basic form of the Survey Project on freeCodeCamp.  Retooled the CSS Grid format, added CSS style elements to the page, and added the topical questions and answers for the survey.

**Thoughts:** Its basic, but it is *technically* finished!  I'll do some more editing to it later, but for now its good.  I want to move on the the Product Landing Page project tomorrow.

### Day 5: January 29th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Started Product Landing Page Project on freeCodeCamp.  Laid basic HTML structure. Reviewed some HTML and CSS to refresh.

**Thoughts:** Probably should have done more than this, but progress is progress.  Got too distracted reviewing. I'm eager to move onto Javascript so that should be good motivation for picking up the pace with these projects!

### Day 6: January 30th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Worked on the CSS for Product Landing Page project.  Added Flex Box properties. Further reading on HTML/CSS.

**Thoughts:** Definitely did a lot of reviewing/searching on freeCodeCamp and W3Schools.  Tires were spinning a lot more than I would have liked, but I still got something noticeable done.  Even though I struggled a bit, I feel content knowing that its days like this that really solidify the learning process.

### Day 7: February 1st, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Added video to Product Landing page project.  Made some minor amendments to HTML and CSS. Now meeting 13/16 basic requirements for project.

**Thoughts:** Real life happened on January 31st and I didn't get to do any coding.  Per the rules at https://www.100daysofcode.com/faq/ I am okay to continue as normal - I just need to add another day on at the end.  I felt guilty missing a day, but these things happen.  I'm pretty determined to do *A LOT* over the weekend.

### Day 8: February 4th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Amended HTML and CSS on Product Landing page.  Solved issues with nav links and HTML validation on email submit form. Have now completed 15 of 16 user stories.

**Thoughts:** Guilty conscience again - didn't do enough since the 1st.  Technically I've broken the official rules, but going to soldier on!  I should be done with the basic solution for the product landing page soon.  Once that's done I'm going to try to finish up the last two as expediently as possible.  Then, I can go back and refactor some of the projects a bit and add some more content.  I'm very eager to start Javascript Algos and Data Structures Cert on FCC, but I know I need to make sure I've done a decent job on the Rsponsive Web Design projects first.

### Day 8: February 5th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Completed all user stories for the Product Landing Page.  Laid HTML structure for Technical Documentation Page Project for freeCodeCamp and completed 12 of 16 user stories.

**Thoughts:** I'll need to refactor the Product Landing Page like my other projects that I've "*completed*." I may strip it down and rework a bit since I don't like how the CSS turned out.  Definitely need to work on grasping flexbox and media queries.  Still, I'd like to work ahead and complete the remaining projects soon so I can get to refactoring the earlier ones this week.  Getting ever-so closer to the Responsive Web Design certification!
