# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 24th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Set up repositories on Github for freeCodeCamp/Codepen projects and 100 Days of Code Challenge. Uploaded basic finished version of Tribute Page Project and started work on Survey Form Project.  Installed Git.

**Thoughts:** Slowly grasping things more and more.  Still a long way off.  Need to get back into making progress on CS50, as I've let that sit for too long.  Need to set up a repository for those projects too.

### Day 1: January 25th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Did some more basic HTML coding of Survey Form Project on freeCodeCamp. Reviewed some of the challenges to keep fresh and also took a look at some info on W3Schools.

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as much done today as I would have wanted, but I had to stay later at work than anticipated.  That ate into my time a bit more than I would have liked.  Still, glad I got some things done today.  Need to spend some time coding this weekend and maybe get some CS50 done.  Also I HAVE to start getting better acquainted with Github/Git so I can update repositories, etc. correctly.

### Day 2: January 26th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Worked a little bit on Survey Form Project.  Added a tiny bit of CSS.  Read up a bit on freeCodeCamp and W3Schools to refresh.  Started using Git Bash to push commits from local to Github.

**Thoughts:** Really felt accomplished despite my minimal progress on the actual project.  Pushing via Git Bash rather than Github felt like a big step.  I'm eager to learn more of the intracacies of Git and growing progressively more comfortable using it.

### Day 3: January 27th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Worked on Survey Project again.  Added classes and implemented a CSS grid.  Project is now better organized visually and CSS style has been applied in a more efficient manner.

**Thoughts:** Definitely muddled through some things, but I think I understand the difference between *class* and *id* better now.  Also was good to implement a CSS Grid and get a feel for that outside of the brief feeCodeCamp challenge.  Another day where I wish I had done some more, but it was nice to enjoy a bit of free time on a weekend.

### Day 4: January 28th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Finished the basic form of the Survey Project on freeCodeCamp.  Retooled the CSS Grid format, added CSS style elements to the page, and added the topical questions and answers for the survey.

**Thoughts:** Its basic, but it is *technically* finished!  I'll do some more editing to it later, but for now its good.  I want to move on the the Product Landing Page project tomorrow.

### Day 5: January 29th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Started Product Landing Page Project on freeCodeCamp.  Laid basic HTML structure. Reviewed some HTML and CSS to refresh.

**Thoughts:** Probably should have done more than this, but progress is progress.  Got too distracted reviewing. I'm eager to move onto Javascript so that should be good motivation for picking up the pace with these projects!

### Day 6: January 30th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Worked on the CSS for Product Landing Page project.  Added Flex Box properties. Further reading on HTML/CSS.

**Thoughts:** Definitely did a lot of reviewing/searching on freeCodeCamp and W3Schools.  Tires were spinning a lot more than I would have liked, but I still got something noticeable done.  Even though I struggled a bit, I feel content knowing that its days like this that really solidify the learning process.

### Day 7: February 1st, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Added video to Product Landing page project.  Made some minor amendments to HTML and CSS. Now meeting 13/16 basic requirements for project.

**Thoughts:** Real life happened on January 31st and I didn't get to do any coding.  Per the rules at https://www.100daysofcode.com/faq/ I am okay to continue as normal - I just need to add another day on at the end.  I felt guilty missing a day, but these things happen.  I'm pretty determined to do *A LOT* over the weekend.

### Day 8: February 4th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Amended HTML and CSS on Product Landing page.  Solved issues with nav links and HTML validation on email submit form. Have now completed 15 of 16 user stories.

**Thoughts:** Guilty conscience again - didn't do enough since the 1st.  Technically I've broken the official rules, but going to soldier on!  I should be done with the basic solution for the product landing page soon.  Once that's done I'm going to try to finish up the last two as expediently as possible.  Then, I can go back and refactor some of the projects a bit and add some more content.  I'm very eager to start Javascript Algos and Data Structures Cert on FCC, but I know I need to make sure I've done a decent job on the Rsponsive Web Design projects first.

### Day 9: February 5th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Completed all user stories for the Product Landing Page.  Laid HTML structure for Technical Documentation Page Project for freeCodeCamp and completed 12 of 16 user stories.

**Thoughts:** I'll need to refactor the Product Landing Page like my other projects that I've "*completed*." I may strip it down and rework a bit since I don't like how the CSS turned out.  Definitely need to work on grasping flexbox and media queries.  Still, I'd like to work ahead and complete the remaining projects soon so I can get to refactoring the earlier ones this week.  Getting ever-so closer to the Responsive Web Design certification!

### Day 10: February 6th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Completed all user stories for the Technical Documentation Page project on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts:** Felt good to finish up the user stories for this one.  Next step is either refactoring or moving ahead to the Personal Portfolio Page project on FCC.  Thinking I'll go ahead and work on it and make sure its my **best** job, then refactoring the completed projects to ensure I've done them to the best of my current ability.

### Day 11: February 7th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Completed 7 of 12 user stories for the Personal Portfolio Webpage Project on freeCodeCamp. Laid initial structural HTML and started some of the CSS styling.

**Thoughts:** This will be the first project that I finish satisfactorily from the start.  After I'm finished with this, I ***need*** to go back and refactor all other projects.  Once I have some confidence built up, I'll put them on the FCC forums for some review/criticism.  Excited and nervous!

### Day 12: February 8th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Did some more work on HTML and CSS for the Personal Portfolio project on freeCodeCamp.  Spent a good amount of time reading up on FCC and W3Schools as well.

**Thoughts:** Would have liked to have gotten more done, but pretty tired tonight.  I'll be doing a good amount of work over the weekend, as I'd really like to get my portfolio site looking nice and maybe do some CS50 since I keep saying I'll get back to it.  If I have time, I'll go back and refactor my previous projects to get them up to snuff too.

### Day 13: February 9th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Finished all user stories for the Personal Portfolio project on FCC.  Spent decent amount of time researching typical sources for HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** Mainly messed with the CSS side of things today.  Needed to do a little HTML wrangling, but cleaning up the CSS was the main issue today.  Feeling pretty good.  Next I want to do more styling and structural work to really round this project out.  After that, its back to refactor the other projects.  I sound like a broken record, but I'll get to CS50 if I can.

### Day 14: February 10th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Worked some more on Personal Portfolio Page project on FCC.  Added social/profile icons, did some general styling and cleaned it up a bit.  Also cleaned up Tribute Page project and added blockquote.

**Thoughts:** Finished the bulk of work I wanted to do on the Personal Portfolio project, so that's good!  Now I'm cleaning up and refactoring older projects and then posting on the FCC Forums for some feedback/criticism.  Should be helpful!  Each day it feels like more and more makes sense.  Using flexgrid today came pretty quick once I reviewed for a minute.

### Day 15: February 12th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Read recommendations for Survey Project that I posted on FCC Forums.  Removed border box and started to amend responsiveness via @media query.

**Thoughts:** Really frustrating today that I didn't get more done. I couldn't figure out how to make the border box behave when viewing the site from mobile, so I just got rid of it.  Looks better now on mobile, but it now accentuates all the whitespace.  Need to fix that next.  It doesn't help that even after taking a day off yesterday, I'm still really tired.  Guess I'll have to do more tomorrow.  Discouraged a bit, but I'll bounce back!

### Day 16: February 20th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Completed a portion of the Basic Javascript section on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Its been awhile - glad to be coding again!  As you might see from my Twitter - @abarrydev - I needed to take a break from coding in order to get my priorities realigned and apply some much needed self-care.  Truth be told, I was obsessing a bit too much and not getting enough sleep.  That, combined with some travel for my day job, meant that I needed to take some personal time and get more sleep too.  I wasn't planning on restarting this until 2/28 or 3/1, but I managed to get comfortable and find some time today.  It feels great!

### Day 17: February 21th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Continued to work through the Javascript section of freeCodeCamp again today.

**Thoughts:** Slow, steady and relaxed pace.  Still, feels good to get something done. As mentioned before, I'll ramp it up once I'm back from travelling for work.  For now... its time to get some sleep!

### Day 18: March 3rd, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Reviewed previous Javascript lessons and continued to work through the Javascript section of freeCodeCamp again today.

**Thoughts:** Back for real now!  Been too busy with life and work related duties as mentioned before and on my Twitter @abarrydev.  Since its been a while, I went back and redid the FCC Basic Javascript lessons I had already completed and continued to work through it.  I'm about 2/3 of the way through now, so on the home stretch!  Still plenty to do, but I'm up to the challenge.  Sidenote - felt immensely rewarding to get stuck on a couple lessons and work my way through it without any extra help.

### Day 19: March 4th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Continued with the Basic Javascript section of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Only worked for a couple of hours and I was already pretty tired when I started.  Still, made some progress. I felt pretty good that I understood what was going on while solving the Golf and Blackjack problems.  Blackjack in particular was a bit tricky.  Still a bit left to go, but I need to ensure I get enough sleep!

### Day 20: March 5th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Continued (again) with the Basic Javascript section of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I really wanted to finsh today, but the last quarter or so of the FCC lessons on Basic JS is much more time consuming than I thought.  Doesn't help that I've been doing these a bit later at night and I'm getting tired as I try to finish them.  Back at it again tomorrow.

### Day 21: March 6th, 2019
**Today's Progress:** More JS Basics work on freeCodeCamp. Worked through the JSON Record Collection problem, iterating through loops and nesting loops.

**Thoughts:** This ending portion is tough!  I sound like a broken record, but its true.  Its taking a lot longer to solve these, but it feels pretty rewarding when I do.  I think I'm starting to grasp some of the JS concepts better as I work on these tougher problems.
