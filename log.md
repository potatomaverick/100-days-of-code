# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 24th, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Set up repositories on Github for FreeCodeCamp/Codepen projects and 100 Days of Code Challenge. Uploaded basic finished version of Tribute Page Project and started work on Survey Form Project.  Installed Git.

**Thoughts:** Slowly grasping things more and more.  Still a long way off.  Need to get back into making progress on CS 50, as I've let that sit for too long.  Need to set up a repository for those projects too.
